## Description: 
Finding love can be hard for anyone, but it is especially hard when you are a graduate student studying Computer Science who is too busy to go on 10 failed dates before finding your true love. That is why we created Match CIT: a dating web app for the MCIT community at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Through Match CIT, students can fill out a curated survey asking them about their personality, interests, values and much more. This data will then be sent to our database, where our own matching algorithm will run on the data and generate a list of top 3 most compatible matches out of all the Match CIT users for each student. Students will then recieve an email showing their top matches, including a compatability score for each match. Our algorithm uses machine learning algorithms such as k means clustering to help generate the results. Now when students go on dates with their matches, they can be sure that they are at least MatchCIT-verified compatible, increasing their chance of finding true love by just a bit more!
